# Destiny - With threading

A discord bot library, written exclusively in python, with aims to have voice support

## Why?

Why make another library when official ones already exist?  The goal mainly is to create another option for those looking to write discord bots, it interfaces low level, and has optional abstraction, allowing the user to cruise on the library or, at their own risk, dive low level.

## How?

This library was started 10 months ago as a hobby project and not even as a library, more of a patchwork bot. It relies on discord's websocket interface as well as its HTTP APi, originally it was a loosely tied collection of python and bash scripts

Interestingly, theoretially the whole bot can be written with a few bach scripts and some fifo's

## Installation

To install this library, since it is currently unavailbale on PyPi, clone the repository, and import as _destiny_

## Why is it called Destiny?

The project is called destiny from the following chain of thought, discord bot -> Discord robot -> Discord Rho bot -> Rho -> density -> destiny, but you could say it was just destiny
